        <p>
            &emsp;Handcrafted websites can offer customability that is unmatched by other services that
            allow for you to create your own. My experience has given me a keen eye for the design
            of a website while leaving me with the technical skills required to fabricate its existence.

        <h2 class="section-title">Why should I choose you?</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;I am like to focus on my customer's needs and desires. I actively communicate with my
            customers in order to meet their demands in a timely fashion. What I am offering is a 
            personable experience that you won't be able to find from a corporation.

        <h2 class="section-title">What I need</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;Once you are sure you wish for me to create your website, you will need to send
            me a sketch or a in depth description of what you wish me to do. If you do not know
            what you want you can tell me the purpose or business that I am making the website
            for and I can draft a few very primitive ideas for you to check out.
